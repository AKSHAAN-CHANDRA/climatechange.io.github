              In principle, this technology already exists: Direct Air Capture of CO2 draws carbon dioxide from the air so that it can be stored underground or transformed into products.</p>

        <p class="modern-food-production">But the implementation process would be very costly Because with the technology we have right now, this would cost some 10,000,000,000,000 $/year
         , or half the United States GDP. </p></div>

            <p class="compare">Just dumping these costs on massive polluters like steel mills and coal power stations would double the cost of their products – and so these industries that operate on very tight profit margins would go 
             bankrupt. Getting the government to pay for it seems logical but a lot of state resources are actually tied up doing the opposite, like subsidizing oil and gas. Which seems counter intuitive but follows clear incentives.</p>

            <p>
              By artificially keeping fuel prices low, shipping and everyday goods are kept artificially cheap too. Which has a major social impact on billions of people around the world. Means they could afford them easily</p>

                That creates political lobbies and incentives that perpetuate this cycle that makes it so hard to cut off fossil fuel production.</p></div>

                <p>
                  Some argue that a move away from capitalism is the only solution to this mess, others insist that markets should be even freer, without any interventions like subsidies and some suggest 
                  that we need what’s referred to as “degrowth” and to cut back as a species overall.</p></div>

                    But the truth is at least as of now, no political system is doing an impressive job at becoming 
                    truly sustainable and none have really done so in the past. 
                    We also don’t have the time to figure this out and do a lot of experiments. 
                    We must implement solutions now. 
                    Not just to halt the release of all possible greenhouse gases, but also to start reducing 
                    the amount of CO2 in the air. 
                    It’s too late to just mend our ways, we have to actively correct our past mistakes. 
                    With every year we waste, more extreme changes will be unavoidable.</p></div>
