            <p>A narrative of our time is that we are all responsible for rapid climate change. That everyone needs to play their part. But how?:</p></div>
      
       <h2>WHY DON'T YOU BUY A NEW ELECTRIC CAR ?</h2> 
       <h2> WHY DON'T YOU REPLACE YOUR GAS STOVE WITH AN ELECTRC ONE ?</h2> 
       <h2>WHY DON'T YOU DOUBLE GLAZE YOUR WINDOWS ?</h2>  
       <h2>STOP EATING MEAT</h2>  
       <h2>SWITCH OFF YOUR LIGHTS</h2>  
       <h2>SWITCH TO RENEWABLES.</h2> 
     
      <div class="container">
         <p>There’s an extra bonus if solving rapid climate change sells a new product. If you don’t have the money or time for these things, you should feel bad. It’s an effective message because it is true. 
          The quickest way to cut CO2 emissions would be if all rich populations on Earth drastically 
          changed their lifestyles and if the people on the rise would not seek to achieve it. 
          Favouring the climate over comfort and wealth.</p></div>
          <div class="container">  <p>Personal contributions toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions are nice, but they are dwarfed 
            by the systemic reality of global emissions. </p></div>

              If you eliminated 100% of your emissions for the rest of your life, you would save one 
              second’s worth of emissions from the global energy sector.</p></div>
