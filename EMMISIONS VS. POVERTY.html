            <p>There is a clear connection between the prosperity of a nation and its carbon emissions. In other words, richer people tend to cause more emissions.</p>

    <p>Higher</p>
            
            <p> 63% of global emissions come from low to middle income countries. Countries where most people are not living extravagantly but are trying to escape poverty
              at worst, and achieve a comfortable lifestyle at best.

            <p class="textalign"> 8% of CO2 emissions are released by the concrete manufacturing industry. So lets not use it. But right now, concrete is also a cheap and easy way for growing populations 
                in developing countries to build affordable housing.</p>

           <p>Even rich countries aren’t immune from disagreeing about rapid climate change solutions. Banning coal, gas and oil from the energy mix is slowed down by heated discussions about what should replace them. Citizens can be strictly against nuclear power but also oppose wind or solar infrastructure in their backyards.</p>
