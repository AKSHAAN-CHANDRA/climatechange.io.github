            We need a different way to think and talk about rapid climate change. 
            An all-encompassing systemic approach, nothing less than changing the fundamentals of our 
            modern industrial societies. 
            As discussed in frustrating length, the personal responsibility angle is overplayed. 
            For systemic changes in technology, politics and the economy of this magnitude, we need 
            to influence the people at the levers.</p></div>
    
    
  <img src="resources/images/Screenshot (138).png" >
  <div class="container">
<p class="modern-food-production">
      When industries fight against changing their ways, for fear of losses or in an honest attempt to protect their own, we need politicians to change the laws and incentivise the deployment 
      of existing technologies and massively invest in innovation for the fields where we don’t have great solutions yet.</p></div>
</div>
       

     <div class="container"><p class="modern-food-production">
          There is no reason that the profit interests of industries could not match the need to reduce carbon emissions as much as possible.</p></div>
    
    
    
    <div class="container"><p>  And if they still don’t cooperate harsh punishments and regulation need to force or bankrupt them. It's still unrealistic that change of that scope can be forced onto a worldwide economy quickly enough, because many low carbon technologies still need a 
    lot of time and research – which means they are expensive.</p></div>
    <img src="resources/images/Screenshot (147).png">
    <div class="container"><p>
      But more companies will make more efficient carbon capture systems, tasty meat alternatives, better batteries, cement substtutes and so on, if there is a clear and growing demand. 
      And if you are affluent enough, you can do your part by investing in these things right now while they're still expensive. These are the mechanisms that will drive the prices down later on.</p></div>
      <div class="container">  <h2>SO THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO</h2></div>
    
      <img src="resources/images/Screenshot (149).png">
      <div class="container">
    <p>
      There are too many opposing interests and complicated grey zones. In the end if we truly get the systemic change we need, everybody will be unhappy about some aspect of it. But such is life. 
    Only if we all accept that some solutions will have negative impacts for us, can we 
    have an honest conversation and make progress. 
    Everybody will be a little unhappy. 
    And that is ok. 
    This is the best you can do. 
    You can deal with the reality of the situation and promote your priorities through your behaviour 
    and your actions. 
    And while you do so, you can eat less meat, fly less or get an electric car. 
    Not because you should feel guilty if you don’t or because you naively believe that 
    you alone can stop rapid climate change – but to do your tiny, tiny part for the systemic 
    change we need. </p></div>
